# discourse-category-header-links

A modification of the custom-header-links that displays desired categories and optional post count.

Note: The current version assumes that the (category id - 1) is the same as its position in the sites categories array. If this is not true for your site, this theme component will not work properly.

Theme component is provided as-is with no guarantees.
